# OpenSCAD models

Models I made in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).
Things as gifts and gadgets.

The .scad-Files in this folder are the *originals*.
The [STL](STL) folder contains the exported [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) files which are then printed on the [Form 2](http://formlabs.com/products/3d-printers/form-2/) 3D printer I have access to at work.
The STL files are also nicely rendered in your browser thanks to [GitHubs STL viewer](https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing).

This repository originally contained a bunch of sample holders I made for work (I work with micro-tomography machines at the University of Bern).
The files here are only *play*, the files in in the forked repository ([TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs](https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs)) are all *work*.
